        <h3>Description</h3>
        <p>For undiluted, deep chocolate flavor, this creamy pudding uses cocoa powder instead of melted chocolate. The type of cocoa powder you choose will affect the final flavor of the pudding: Dutch-processed cocoa powder has been treated with an alkali, which neutralizes its natural acidity, while natural cocoa powder has not. Natural cocoa powder has a fruity chocolate flavor, while Dutch-processed cocoa is more mellow and smooth â€” and will result in a darker pudding. The custard will still look loose when the rice has cooked but it will continue to thicken as it cools. Once cool, you can stir in a little bit of milk or cream to loosen it as necessary.</p>
        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>4 cups/945 milliliters whole milk</li>
            <li>1/2 cup/47 grams unsweetened cocoa powder (Dutch-processed or natural), plus more for garnish, if you like</li>
            <li>1/3 cup/71 grams short-grain rice (such as arborio)</li>
            <li>1/4 cup/55 grams packed brown sugar (dark or light)</li>
            <li>1/2 teaspoon kosher salt (such as Diamond Crystal)</li>
            <li>2 large egg yolks</li>
            <li>3 tablespoons marple syrup (preferably dark)</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons pure vanilla extract</li>
            <li>Whipped cream, for serving</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>In a medium, heavy-bottomed pot, bring milk, cocoa powder, rice, brown sugar and salt to a boil over medium heat, stirring occasionally. (The cocoa powder will not incorporate fully until the milk is warm.) Immediately reduce the heat to medium-low to maintain a gentle simmer.</li>
            <li>Cook, stirring often, until the milk has reduced and thickened and the rice is very tender, about 20 minutes. Remove the pot from the heat and stir in the egg yolks, maple syrup and vanilla. It will look loose at this point, but it will thicken as it cools.</li>
            <li>Serve warm or chilled, with whipped cream and a sprinkle of cocoa, if you like. Refrigerate, in an airtight container, for up to 2 days.</li>
        </ol>
