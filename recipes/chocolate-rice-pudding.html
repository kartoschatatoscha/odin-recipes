        <h3 class="heading sub">Description</h3>
        <p>For undiluted, deep chocolate flavor, this creamy pudding uses cocoa powder instead of melted chocolate. The type of cocoa powder you choose will affect the final flavor of the pudding: Dutch-processed cocoa powder has been treated with an alkali, which neutralizes its natural acidity, while natural cocoa powder has not. Natural cocoa powder has a fruity chocolate flavor, while Dutch-processed cocoa is more mellow and smooth â€” and will result in a darker pudding. The custard will still look loose when the rice has cooked but it will continue to thicken as it cools. Once cool, you can stir in a little bit of milk or cream to loosen it as necessary.</p>

        <ul>
            <li><span class="number">4</span> cups/<span class="number">945</span> milliliters whole milk</li>
            <li><span class="number">1/2</span> cup/<span class="number">47</span> grams unsweetened cocoa powder (Dutch-processed or natural), plus more for garnish, if you like</li>
            <li><span class="number">1/3</span> cup/<span class="number">71</span> grams short-grain rice (such as arborio)</li>
            <li><span class="number">1/4</span> cup/<span class="number">55</span> grams packed brown sugar (dark or light)</li>
            <li><span class="number">1/2</span> teaspoon kosher salt (such as Diamond Crystal)</li>
            <li><span class="number">2</span> large egg yolks</li>
            <li><span class="number">3</span> tablespoons marple syrup (preferably dark)</li>
            <li><span class="number">2</span> tablespoons pure vanilla extract</li>
            <li>Whipped cream, for serving</li>
        </ul>
        <h3 class="heading sub">Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>In a medium, heavy-bottomed pot, bring milk, cocoa powder, rice, brown sugar and salt to a boil over medium heat, stirring occasionally. (The cocoa powder will not incorporate fully until the milk is warm.) Immediately reduce the heat to medium-low to maintain a gentle simmer.</li>
            <li>Cook, stirring often, until the milk has reduced and thickened and the rice is very tender, about <span class="number">20</span> minutes. Remove the pot from the heat and stir in the egg yolks, maple syrup and vanilla. It will look loose at this point, but it will thicken as it cools.</li>
            <li>Serve warm or chilled, with whipped cream and a sprinkle of cocoa, if you like. Refrigerate, in an airtight container, for up to <span class="number">2</span> days.</li>
        </ol>
